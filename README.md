### ðŸ“Œ Abstract  
The rise of Deep Learning (DL) has enabled the creation of hyper-realistic synthetic images via Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). While these images showcase the potential of DL, they also present serious risks, including misinformation and cybersecurity threats. This paper introduces an efficient deepfake detection framework using **MobileNetV4-Small**, a lightweight DL model optimized for mobile and edge devices. The approach leverages **advanced preprocessing techniques** to improve classification accuracy and achieves an **89.78% test accuracy** on the OpenForensics dataset. Our findings highlight the importance of **lightweight architectures** in combating the challenges posed by synthetic media.
